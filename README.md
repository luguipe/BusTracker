## Roadmap of Future Improvements
Future plans for the application include:
- Adding a search feature to plan journeys from specific starting locations to MIT or Harvard.
- Integrating options for different transport modes directly within the application.
- Implementing functionality to use the device's current location as a starting point.

## Additional Features for User Benefit
